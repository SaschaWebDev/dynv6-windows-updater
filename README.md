# dynv6-windows-updater

A nodejs windows application to update your IPv6 address to dynv6.com (IPv6 DynDNS)

## üí° Motivation

After my ISP switched the Internet connection to [DS-Lite](https://avm.de/service/wissensdatenbank/dok/FRITZ-Box-6690-Cable/1611_Was-ist-DS-Lite-und-wie-funktioniert-es) without my knowledge, I noticed that all devices were no longer remotely reachable from IPv4 clients, such as the smartphone or hotel wifi. Looking for a solution I discovered Dynv6.com as an DynDNS provider for IPv6 addresses. The device which the DynDNS should run on uses Windows but the only officially linked IPv6 DynDNS Windows software called [Dynephant](https://github.com/chriv/dynephant) is deprecated since years and does not work anymore. So I decided to write my own application running on Windows which is directly connected to the Dyn6.com API.

## ‚ú® Features

- Lightweight Nodejs server
- Fetches the external IPv6 of the executing device, checks for validity and updates Dynv6.com Zone Record data
- Can be run as Windows service on every system start
- Runs as cronjob every 10 minutes
